<h2>About me</h2>

      <center><p> Hello my name is Macy, I am 19 years old studying Media production
        at De Montfort Universtiy. After reading the title you are all probably
        thinking Why am I going to read about about someone being born, surely
        it is the same as everyone else after 9 months. I can assure you me coming
        into the world was definetley not normal and my parents did not have the
        most wonderful experience either.</p><center>

     The images across your site aren't loading. The folder with your images in is called Img, with a capital
     I. However, in your URLs, you write img with a lowercase i. On your own computer, when you open the file in 
     the browser, this is fine, as your computers file system sees them both as the same thing.

     However, the GitHub Pages server is case sensitive, so these things are different.

       <p> I was very premature, My due date was originally December 10th,
         I suppose I was very excited to come into the world and I was born August
         24th 2001 on my mums birthday down a toilet- Thankfully my mum caught me.
         So on my mums 32nd birthday she spent it in hospital trying to persuade the
         nurses that she was in labour, went to the toilet, I flew out, she (Thankfully)
         caught me. I overal weighed 1 Pound 6 Ounces and was in an incubator for about 4
         months before returning home for the first evert time in December.
