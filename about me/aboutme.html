<h2>About me</h2>

      <center><p> Hello my name is Macy, I am 19 years old studying Media production
        at De Montfort Universtiy. After reading the title you are all probably
        thinking Why am I going to read about about someone being born, surely
        it is the same as everyone else after 9 months. I can assure you me coming
        into the world was definetley not normal and my parents did not have the
        most wonderful experience either.</p><center>

       <p> I was very premature, My due date was originally December 10th,
         I suppose I was very excited to come into the world and I was born August
         24th 2001 on my mums birthday down a toilet- Thankfully my mum caught me.
         So on my mums 32nd birthday she spent it in hospital trying to persuade the
         nurses that she was in labour, went to the toilet, I flew out, she (Thankfully)
         caught me. I overal weighed 1 Pound 6 Ounces and was in an incubator for about 4
         months before returning home for the first evert time in December.
