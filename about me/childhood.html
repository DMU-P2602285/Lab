<p> After having a very complicated beginning to this world. My childhood was pretty
normal. Went to primary school, had many hobbies such as swimming, Ballet,baking, chior
(even though I cant sing), Drama and many more. I also loved, colouring and art but
hated maths and still do to this day. Growing up my favourite channel on the telly
had to be Disney channel- I went through a phase being very obsessed with
Hannah Montana and Wizards of Waverly Place.</p>

<!-- add images, and videos that relate to me as a child-->

<p style="color: blue"> Here is some music which is similar style to what I danced
to when I did ballet.</p>

  <!-- ***
       Your audio elements should have at least two source elements, with the audio file in different 
       file formats. You should also include some text after the <source> elements as a fallback for
       browsers that don't support the <audio> element. This could helpfully also provide a link
       to download the mp3 version. 
       
       Also, you've added controls, which is good, but you don't need to explicitly set them to true as 
       you have here. Just including the name of the attribute will set it to true. So, you would just have
      
           <audio controls> 

       *** -->
<audio controls="true">
<source src="Audio/ballet .wav" type="audio/wav" />
</audio>

<p>Here are a couple of images from when I was younger.</p>

<img style='max-width: 25%' src='img/bake.jpg' />

<img style='max-width: 25%' src='img/balletphoto.jpg' />

  <!-- ***
       The two sources here are good, though note that your actual video folder has a capital V - Video, so 
       as with your images, the browser doesn't find these files. Ah, you've not closed your <source> elements
       either. You need a /> on the end of each one. 

       You've got the fallback for older browsers, but it should go just inside the <video> element, not after it.
       *** -->
<video controls="true">
  <source src="video/Ballet.mp4" type="video/mp4"
  <source src="video/Ballet.webm" type="video/webm"
</video>
<p>
sorry, your browser does not support the video element. You can download the
video <a href="video/Ballet.MP4">here</a></p>
