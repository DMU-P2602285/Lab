<p> After having a very complicated beginning to this world. My childhood was pretty
normal. Went to primary school, had many hobbies such as swimming, Ballet,baking, chior
(even though I cant sing), Drama and many more. I also loved, colouring and art but
hated maths and still do to this day. Growing up my favourite channel on the telly
had to be Disney channel- I went through a phase being very obsessed with
Hannah Montana and Wizards of Waverly Place.</p>
