<!--I am doing this so the audience will have a clearer understanding of the cast.
putting an image into a website/post makes it more visual and helps the website stand more out.
I have decided to put the image at 25% this makes it the correct size and doesnt look to small or
too big if I were to keep it at 100%. having all three images similar sizing makes it more
aesthetically to view rather than the images being all seperate sizing.
We learnt how to import images in atom towards the beggining of the academic years
and since then I have experimented on the different sizes of the images. -->

<!-- Using 'Audio controls="true" allows the audience to view the audio. If I
wasnt going to use the controls true, then the audience wont be able to listen to the audio,
the same goes for the video too. If I didnt do the same for the video then the video
would only show the first frame as an image instead of the video which is not what
we would want to show-->


<h3>Ezra Miller-Patrick</h3>
