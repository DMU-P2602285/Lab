  <p>Socially awkward teen Charlie (Logan Lerman) is a wallflower,
    always watching life from the sidelines, until two charismatic students
    become his mentors.

  Free-spirited Sam (Emma Watson) and her stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller)
    help Charlie discover the joys of friendship, first love, music and more,
    while a teacher sparks Charlie's dreams of becoming a writer. However, as
    his new friends prepare to leave for college, Charlie's inner sadness
    threatens to shatter his newfound confidence.</p>

<!--I have decided to make the width of the video 50% this is because when it was
at 100% it was far to big and looked very unprofessional, after looking at some
of the websites I have never seen the width of the video so big, so minimising it down
to 50% was the right idea. I also added a poster to the video so the audience
will know what roughly who the castmates are before clicking on the link to watch the
video.-->
